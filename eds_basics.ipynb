    "DigitalMicrograph files are similar in that each .dm3 file (one for each of ADF, EDS, LL-EELS, CL-EELS, etc.) can be imported and processed easily enough. Files imported from dm3s into hyperspy will have less metadata than bcf though (not sure whether DM writes less, or hyperspy reads less).\n",
    "#### Aztec\n",
    "Aztec files cannot directly be imported for time being (apparently a convenient hyperspy-friendly format is in the works) but there is a (slightly awkward) workaround. In Aztec you can export each spectrum image within a project as in '.raw'/'.rpl' format. This gives two files, one containing the numerical data and the other containing headers which refer to the data (similar to .ser and .emi from FEI). The .rpl file can be read by hyperspy (provided corresponding .raw file is in the same directory with the same name) however it doesn't include any calibration nor metadata. To calibrate the spatial and energy axes you then need to go to Aztec to find them, then manually enter them in hyperspy's axes_manager for each file. You can export a export a summed spectra from Aztec, import it as a .emsa file alongside the .rpl file, then use it to calibrate the energy axis and give some metadata.\n",

Spatial binning will improve the signal at each pixel (boosting the number of counts), improving the overall SNR but will reduce the spatial resolution of your map. Binning the energy axes will also boost counts at each pixel but at the expense of spectral resolution, meaning peaks that are close together will merge and any maps derived will have severe problems. Practically speak the energy axes from 0 to 20 keV should have at least 512 channels, if not 1024."

This can then be subtracted from X-ray counts measured using 'get_lines_intensity'.\n",
